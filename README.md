# Capstone Project: Spotify Song Classification and Recommender

By: Veda Patel 

This project was carried out from May-June 2023. 

## Background:

In today's digital music industry, there is an abundance of ways people can listen to music. Music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music have transformed the way we listen to music by providing instant access to their extensive library of songs from millions of artists across various genres. However, individuals often have diverse musical preferences and might want to make playlists dependent on their mood or the atmosphere they want to create. By looking into Spotify's API for developers, I found that you can retrieve a song's audio features like danceability, energy, and tempo. With the Spotify API, I saw an opportunity to utilize these audio features to categorize songs into distinct "moods" and recommend songs for a user's playlists.

## Problem Statement:

By looking closer at the the patterns among song audio features and utilizing clustering techniques, this project aims to develop a music classification model and recommendation system that enhances a users experience and helps them to curate playlists aligned with their desired mood or vibe. The clustering models will be evaluated based on their silhouette score and the distribution of clusters. The multiclass classification model for the clusters will be assessed for accuracy, F1, precision, and recall scores, prioritized in that order. Evaluating the recommender system is not as simple, since it is subjective to each individual user's preferences.
